# WaniKani Mobile

## About this project

WaniKani is a website that provides an awesome tool to study the so called "Kanji", the chinese characters that the Japanese language uses amongst two other alphabets. Depending on their use and context they have different meanings and readings which makes the process of learning these probably one of the hardest parts about studying the Japanese language. Unfortunately, there is no official mobile app for WaniKani.

As of writing, I just finished my 3-month Web Development bootcamp at neue fische. For my capstone project, I wanted to create a mobile app using the WaniKani API to study anywhere, even if I can't use my laptop right now. The bootcamp is finished, but my app is not (yet). So keep that in mind when going through the code. I planned a lot of features, knowing very well that I won't be finished after just the 4 weeks of the capstone phase.

For using the app you will need a personal API token. Though I mentioned it inside the app I do not yet recommend to give that token any permissions if you don't want to mess up your SRS. There are bugs, but they will be fixed asap.
